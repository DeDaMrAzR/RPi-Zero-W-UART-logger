This project is meant to use Rpi Zero W and CH342 dual UART module to connected to OTG port in order to capture/sniff UART data on the target device. 

Once I have all the files ready I'll upload more necesery files that are required for this to work like scripts to make the RPi work in this mode, connection diagrams, pictures and maybe even RPi image for the fastes deployment method.
